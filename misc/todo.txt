workspace

-> local dev environment (to upload/download files, logistics)
-> cloud dev environment (to code/test)
-> running both (code on cloud may not run on local as expected)
-> different instruction sets (x86 cloud vs ARM local)

basically the local dev env, has a local image of your cloud
this is why you need to pull from the CLOUD to LOCAL (to submit files)

todo:
- chapter 1 notes (w/ code try out fully)
- chapter 2 notes (w/ code try out fully)
- go over lecture videos 4-8, skim them
- try out assignment 1/2 again, or go over mini quizzes
